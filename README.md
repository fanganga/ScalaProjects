Projects developed for learning scala

*I didn't manage to get the sbt to download the mongoDB libraries, and have to rely on having the mongoDB jar in the lib folder for each service that uses it - the jars are not in the git hub repo and should be downloaded from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/mongodb/scala/mongo-scala-driver_2.11/1.0.1/

*The frontend assumes the backend is running on localhost:9001
